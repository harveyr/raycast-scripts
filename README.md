# My Raycast Script Commands

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
allows you to add extensions via
[script commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands).
Here's my fledgling collection.

## [buku-bookmarks.py](buku-bookmarks.py)

This command queries my
[buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku)
database and presents the results.
It's a quick way to get at my bookmarks.

## [chrome-markdown-link.sh](chrome-markdown-link.sh)

This command gives you a Markdown link to the current Chrome tab.
It uses Applescript to get the tab's title and URL,
and then dumps the link into your clipboard.
I use this one a lot!
